## Identifying Causal Effects of Discrete, Ordered Treatments with Multiple Instrumental Variables

> This paper contributes to the literature on identifying causal effects of discrete, ordered treatments when multiple instruments are available. I show that a weighted average of local average treatment effects for combined complier populations is identified under the limited monotonicity assumption.  Offering intuitive weights and encompassing a larger complier population, the proposed estimand presents an attractive alternative to the conventional two-stage least squares estimand. I provide formulas for the weighting function which shed light on the interpretation of the estimates. Necessary conditions that arise from these formulas provide testable implications for the limited monotonicity assumption. I demonstrate how causal forests can be used to detect local violations of this assumption. The results are implemented in an application of the effects of community nurseries on child health outcomes, leveraging recent advances in machine learning methods to preserve the interpretation of the parameter.

## Limited Monotonicity and the Combined Compliers LATE

*with [Arthur Lewbel](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/arthur-lewbel/home) and [Giovanni Mellace](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimellace/)*

> We consider a framework with an endogenous binary treatment and two or more valid binary instruments. First, we introduce a novel limited monotonicity assumption than is generally weaker than alternative monotonicity assumptions considered in the literature and allows for a rich choice heterogeneity. We then show how to identify the the Combined Complier Local Average Treatment Effect (CC-LATE), which is arguably a more policy relevant parameter than the weighted average of LATEs identified by TSLS. Finally, we estimate the effect of learning one's HIV status on protective behaviors.
