## Identifying Causal Effects of Nonbinary, Ordered Treatments using Multiple Instrumental Variables

<details>
  <summary>Show Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote>
  This paper presents a method to identify causal effects of ordered, nonbinary treatments using multiple binary instruments. It generalizes two-stage least squares (TSLS) results for multiple instruments to accommodate nonbinary, ordered treatments and any monotonicity assumption, and highlights some shortcomings of TSLS. The key contribution of this paper is the identification of a novel causal parameter which gives the average causal effect for a large complier population and is identified under a mild monotonicity assumption. This result simplifies the interpretation of causal effects and is also broadly applicable due to the lenient nature of the monotonicity assumption, making it a compelling alternative to TSLS. The paper employs recent advances in causal machine learning for estimation. Finally, it demonstrates how causal forests can be used to detect local violations of the underlying monotonicity assumption.

## Limited Monotonicity and the Combined Compliers LATE

*with [Arthur Lewbel](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/arthur-lewbel/home) and [Giovanni Mellace](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimellace/)*

> We consider endogenous binary treatment with multiple binary instruments. We propose a novel limited monotonicity (LiM) assumption that is generally weaker than alternative monotonicity assumptions in the literature. We define and identify (under LiM) the combined compliers local average treatment effect (CC-LATE), which is arguably a more policy-relevant parameter than the weighted average of LATEs identified by two-stage least squares (TSLS), and is valid under more general conditions. Estimating the CC-LATE is trivial, equivalent to running TSLS with one constructed instrument on a subsample. We use our CC-LATE to empirically assess how knowledge of HIV status influences protective behaviors.

## Nudging Nutrition: Lessons from the Danish "Fat Tax"

*with [Christian MÃ¸ller Dahl](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/christian-m%C3%B8ller-dahl), [Giovanni Mellace](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimellace/), and [Sinne Smed](https://ifro.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en%2Fpersons%2Fsinne-smed(1eeed0bc-bded-473c-bd06-98706e028225).html)*

> In October 2011, Denmark introduced the worldâ€™s first and, to date, only tax targeting saturated fat. However, this tax was subsequently abolished in January 2013. Leveraging exogenous variation from untaxed Northern-German consumers, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the causal effects of both the implementation and repeal of the tax on consumption and expenditure behavior across eight product categories targeted by the tax. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the taxâ€™s impact across these products. During the taxed period, there was a notable decline in consumption of bacon, liver sausage, salami, and cheese, particularly among low-income households. In contrast, expenditure on butter, cream, margarine, and sour cream increased as prices rose. Interestingly, we do not observe any difference in expenditure increases between high and low-income households, suggesting that the latter were disproportionately affected by the tax. After the repeal of the tax, we do not observe any significant decline in consumption. On the contrary, there was an overall increase in consumption for certain products, prompting concerns about unintended consequences resulting from the brief implementation of the tax.
