## Identifying Causal Effects of Nonbinary, Ordered Treatments using Multiple Instrumental Variables

<details>
  <summary>Show Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote>
  This paper introduces a novel method for identifying causal effects of ordered, nonbinary treatments using multiple binary instruments. Extending the two-stage least squares (TSLS)
  framework, the approach accommodates ordered treatments under any monotonicity assumption. The key contribution is the identification of a new causal parameter that simplifies
  the interpretation of causal effects and is broadly applicable due to a mild monotonicity
  assumption, offering a compelling alternative to TSLS. The paper builds upon recent causal
  machine learning methodology for estimation and demonstrates how causal forests can detect
  local violations of the underlying monotonicity assumption. The methodology is applied to
  estimate the returns to education using the seminal dataset of Card (1995) and to evaluate
  the impact of an additional child on female labor market outcomes using the data from
  Angrist and Evans (1998).

## Limited Monotonicity and the Combined Compliers LATE

  <summary>Show Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote>
  We consider endogenous binary treatment with multiple binary instruments. We propose a novel limited monotonicity (LiM) assumption that is generally weaker than alternative monotonicity assumptions in the literature. We define and identify (under LiM) the combined compliers local average treatment effect (CC-LATE), which is arguably a more policy-relevant parameter than the weighted average of LATEs identified by two-stage least squares (TSLS), and is valid under more general conditions. Estimating the CC-LATE is trivial, equivalent to running TSLS with one constructed instrument on a subsample. We use our CC-LATE to empirically assess how knowledge of HIV status influences protective behaviors.

## Nudging Nutrition: Lessons from the Danish "Fat Tax"

  <blockquote>
  In October 2011, Denmark introduced the worldâ€™s first and, to date, only tax targeting saturated fat. However, this tax was subsequently abolished in January 2013. Leveraging exogenous variation from untaxed Northern-German consumers, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the causal effects of both the implementation and repeal of the tax on consumption and expenditure behavior across eight product categories targeted by the tax. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the taxâ€™s impact across these products. During the taxed period, there was a notable decline in consumption of bacon, liver sausage, salami, and cheese, particularly among low-income households. In contrast, expenditure on butter, cream, margarine, and sour cream increased as prices rose. Interestingly, we do not observe any difference in expenditure increases between high and low-income households, suggesting that the latter were disproportionately affected by the tax. After the repeal of the tax, we do not observe any significant decline in consumption. On the contrary, there was an overall increase in consumption for certain products, prompting concerns about unintended consequences resulting from the brief implementation of the tax.
