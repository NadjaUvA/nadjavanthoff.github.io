## Identifying Causal Effects of Discrete, Ordered Treatments with Multiple Instrumental Variables

> This paper addresses the challenge of identifying causal effects of discrete, ordered treatments with multiple binary instruments. I show that a weighted average of local average treatment effects for combined complier populations is identified under the limited monotonicity assumption. The proposed estimand offers intuitive weights and encompasses a large complier population, presenting an appealing alternative to the conventional two-stage least squares estimand. I provide explicit formulas for the weighting function. These formulas give rise to necessary conditions that provide testable implications for the limited monotonicity assumption. I demonstrate how causal forests can be employed to detect local violations of this assumption. The methodology is applied to study the impact of community nurseries on child health outcomes.

## Limited Monotonicity and the Combined Compliers LATE

*with [Arthur Lewbel](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/arthur-lewbel/home) and [Giovanni Mellace](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimellace/)*

> We consider identification of a local average treatment effect given an endogenous binary treatment and two or more valid binary instruments. We propose a novel limited monotonicity assumption that is generally weaker than alternative monotonicity assumptions, and that allows for a great deal of choice heterogeneity. Using this limited monotonicity, we define and identify the Combined Complier Local Average Treatment Effect (CC-LATE), which is arguably a more policy-relevant parameter than the weighted average of LATEs identified by Two Stage Least Squares. We apply our results to estimate the effect of learning of oneâ€™s HIV status on protective behaviors.
