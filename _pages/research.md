## Identifying Causal Effects of Discrete, Ordered Treatments with Multiple Instrumental Variables

> This paper addresses the challenge of identifying causal effects of nonbinary, ordered treatments with multiple binary instruments. Next to presenting novel insights into the widely applied two-stage least squares estimand, I show that a weighted average of local average
treatment effects for combined complier populations is identified under the limited monotonicity assumption. This novel causal parameter has an intuitive interpretation, offering an
appealing alternative to two-stage least squares. I employ recent advances in causal machine
learning for estimation. I further demonstrate how causal forests can be used to detect local
violations of the underlying limited monotonicity assumption. The methodology is applied
to study the impact of community nurseries on child health outcomes.

## Limited Monotonicity and the Combined Compliers LATE

*with [Arthur Lewbel](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/arthur-lewbel/home) and [Giovanni Mellace](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimellace/)*

> We consider identification of a local average treatment effect given an endogenous binary treatment and two or more valid binary instruments. We propose a novel limited monotonicity assumption that is generally weaker than alternative monotonicity assumptions, and that allows for a great deal of choice heterogeneity. Using this limited monotonicity, we define and identify the Combined Complier Local Average Treatment Effect (CC-LATE), which is arguably a more policy-relevant parameter than the weighted average of LATEs identified by Two Stage Least Squares. We apply our results to estimate the effect of learning of oneâ€™s HIV status on protective behaviors.
