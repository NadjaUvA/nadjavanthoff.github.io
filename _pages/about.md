Nadja van 't Hoff
------
I am an Assistant Professor at the Econometrics and Data Science group at the Department of Economics, University of Southern Denmark (SDU).  



Research interests
------
My research is within the field of **microeconometrics**. My interests are **causal inference** and **causal machine learning**, especially the methods for identifying and estimating causal effects in case of **many instrumental variables**. I am also interested in the **empirical application** of these methods to evaluate policy interventions using observational data.
