------
I am an Assistant Professor (non-tenured) at the Econometrics and Data Science group at the Department of Economics, University of Southern Denmark (SDU).  

I will be on the 2024/2025 job market.



Research
------

Primary field: **Econometrics**

Secondary fields: **Causal inference**, **Applied Microeconometrics**

My interests are within the field of **microeconometrics**, specifically **causal inference** and **causal machine learning**, especially the methods for identifying and estimating causal effects in case of **many instrumental variables**. I am also interested in the **empirical application** of these methods within **health economics** to evaluate policy interventions using observational data.
