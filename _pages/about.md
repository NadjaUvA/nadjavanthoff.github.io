ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
------
I am a PhD candiate at the Econometrics and Data Science group at the Department of Economics at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). Expected graduation data is January 2024. My supervisor is [Giovanni Mellace](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimellace/) and my co-supervisor is [Christian MÃ¸ller Dahl](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/christian-m%C3%B8ller-dahl). 



Research interests
------
My research interests are causal inference and causal machine learning, especially the methods for identifying and estimating causal effects in case of many instrumental variables. I am also interested in the empirical application of these methods to evaluate policy interventions within the field of applied microeconometrics.
