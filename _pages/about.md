ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a PhD candiate at the Econometrics and Data Science group at the Department of Economics at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). My suoervisor is Giovanni Mellace and my co-supervisor is Christian MÃ¸ller Dahl. 


Research interests
------
My research interests are causal inference and causal machine learning, especially the methods for identifying and estimating causal effects in case of many instrumental variables. I am also interested in the empirical application of these methods to evaluate policy interventions within the field of applied microeconometrics.
