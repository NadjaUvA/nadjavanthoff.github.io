------
I am an Assistant Professor at the Quantitative Economics Section of the Amsterdam School of Economics, University of Amsterdam (UvA).  



Research
------

Primary field: **Econometrics**

Secondary fields: **Causal inference**, **Applied Microeconometrics**

My interests are within the field of microeconometrics, specifically causal inference and causal machine learning, especially the methods for identifying and estimating causal effects in case of many instrumental variables. I am also interested in the empirical application of these methods within health and development economics to evaluate policy interventions using observational data.
