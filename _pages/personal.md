Powerlifting
------

<p>Outside of work, you can find me in the gym powerlifting. Powerlifting is a strength sport focused on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. I enjoy balancing the mental focus of my work with the physical intensity of training, and I love the process of steady improvement in both.</p>

<p>While I’ve been into fitness for years, a powerlifting course during my research stay at Boston College inspired me to take my training to the next level. I became a certified fitness instructor in October 2022. In September 2024, I competed in my first powerlifting meet, which was a bucket-list goal of mine. One meet turned into two, two turned into… well, let’s just say I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.</p>

The bench press is my favorite lift:

And last but not least, the deadlift:
