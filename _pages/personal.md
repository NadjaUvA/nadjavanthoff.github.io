Powerlifting
------

Outside of work, you can find me in the gym powerlifting. Powerlifting is a strength sport focused on three main lifts: the squat, bench press, and deadlift. I really enjoy balancing the mental focus of my work with the physical intensity of powerlifting.

While Iâ€™ve been into fitness for years, a powerlifting course during my research stay at Boston College inspired me to take my training to the next level. I became a certified fitness instructor in October 2022. In September 2024, I competed in my first powerlifting meet (Speijers Sports Entry-Level Competition), where a 125kg squat, 75kg bench, and 150kg deadlift earned me the gold medal in the 63kg weight class.

Powerlifting has taught me perseverance, consistency, and patience. I love the process of continuous improvement, both in the gym and in my research.

The bench press is my favorite lift:
